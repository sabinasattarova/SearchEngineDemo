Create a test framework using any language and tool(s) that does the following:
1. Visit one or more search engine(s); i.e google, bing, yahoo, etc...
2. Submit a search term
3. On the results page, take the first returned item and assert it as the expected result.

While this may seem like a simple test, you should take into consideration the following requirements.
1. The framework when implemented should use industry standard design patterns and principles.
2. The framework should be capable of supporting enterprise level applications.
3. The framework should minimize the presence of code anti-patterns.
4. The framework should be easily extended and/or modified to satisfy changes in requirements.
